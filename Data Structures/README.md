- Comment: This is one of the best materials to study on data structure topic. William implemented each on Java. But it doesn't really matter which language you use, i did this course in both in c++ and python. And try to code yourself after watching a data structure topic and do some leetcode question on that. And this is all you need to ace DS questions.
